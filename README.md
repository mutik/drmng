# DotD Raids Manager next gen

DRMng is ongoing project which aims to aid Dawn of the Dragons players with raids management and sharing.

Main features are:
* speed
* real time raids importing
* autojoining
* advanced searching
* delayed raids submission
* automatic raids definition update
* automatic raids tiers data update
* automatic keywords update
* UI theming
* alliance chat
* sidebar (configuration not implemented yet)

## Installation

* Ensure you have userscripts manager addon installed. For Firefox it's **Greasemonkey**, for almost all other browsers (Chrome/Safari/Opera/Edge) you'll  be using **Tampermonkey**.
* Open **kong_ng.user.js** file here on github and after that hit **RAW** button. Userscripts manager should intercept stream and allow installation/update.
* Make sure you have **old script disabled** (they don't play nice when run together).
* **Reload tab** with game for changes to take effect.

## TODO

* Sidebar configuration
* Options framework (partially implemented)
* Configuration stored on server
